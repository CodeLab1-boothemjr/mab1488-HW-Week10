# mo-laura-george-HW-week10

## todo:

* add check if two dots are next to each other
* add logic for choosing the correct "line", horizontal or vertical
* add lines addition
* add lines colors
* add (auto)box building
* add boxes building logic - 2d array needed for data
* add score keeping
* add player turn indicator
* set grid zoom + positioning - requires thinking through the logic of it
* add custom grid size
* consider resolving "expensive method invocations" - getComponent, null check

## controls:

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes) page for reference.

## bugs:

* dot selection - if you select a dot, then deselect that same dot, then click that dot as the "third" dot... it will either let you click it anyways or throw a nullpointerexception
